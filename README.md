Galileo: a new snot project

Three parts:

1) boogerd2: application to expose snot operations through REST
   version 2 because kennobaka wrote version 1

2) snotrocket: an application to speed up read and search operations
    uses elasticsearch for cache

3) ???: presentation layer


4) pysnot: a library exposing common snot operations as python functions
