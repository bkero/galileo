PySnot
======


Python library for interacting with snot.


You can import this library then use a number of snot primitives. You should always test with testsnot.


I can't decide if I'd rather have docs come out of docstrings in the code or have docs listed here.


Requirements
------------


Requires snotparser from prill.


Functions
---------


* assign_ticket(ticket_number, user)
** 300ms to run
* assign_ticket_with_validation(ticket_number, user)
** 1.5 sec to run
